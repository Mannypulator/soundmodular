# soundmodular

soundmodular is a library of functions designed to perform real-time signal processing on blocks of audio.
Each function takes inputs and outputs in a similar fashion, hence allowing them to
be aggregated into a signal chain to imitate modular synthesis.

An early version of soundmodular was called SoundModule, which was developed for SERIAL in December 2016.
